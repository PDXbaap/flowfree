An unblockable public VPN on PDX blockchain hypercloud

PDX FlowFree is an unblockable blockchain-based VPN platform operated by everyone and for everyone. It encourages and incentivizes everyone to operate as a VPN proxy. 

It's unblockable in a sense that any host on the internet can be a VPN proxy and it overlays on common TCP ports with strong end-to-end encryption on, so effective blocking cannot be enforced by any regional political entity unless the internet access from the region is shut down or blocked. 

With PDX FlowFree, privacy-sensitive locality-tracking leveraged by almost all websites, is no longer reliable and meaningful. And everyone's internet access is now free from local eavesdropping.

Welcome aboard as a developer, user and/or operator and enjoy the fear-free everyday life with protected data exchange (PDX).
