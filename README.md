An unblockable VPN on PDX blockchain hypercloud

PDX FlowFree is an unblockable blockchain-based VPN platform operated by everyone and for everyone. It encourages and incentivizes everyone to operate as a VPN proxy. 

It's unblockable in a sense that any host on the internet can be a VPN proxy and it overlays on common TCP ports with end-to-end encryption on, so effective blocking cannot be enforced by any political entity unless the internet access from the region is shut down or blocked. 

With PDX FlowFree, privacy-sensitive locality-tracking leveraged by almost any website, is not only reliable and meaningful.
